####ZeroNet Proxy

ZeroNet is a distributed network, a tool that uses a combination of BitCoin and Torrent methodologies to build a network that relies on no particular server.

However, you need ZeroNet installed to use it, and though it runs on just about anything, thanks to the wonders of Python, it isn't always an option to use it.

Hence, the proxy.

This proxy is an [Open Source](//github.com/zeronetproxy/ZeroNetProxy) project that enables anyone anywhere to access ZeroNet.
